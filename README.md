# Tower of Hanoi
Excited to share our latest AI project on solving the classic puzzle game Tower of Hanoi, which built using A* and Greedy algorithms! ðŸ¤–ðŸ§©

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle game that involves moving a stack of disks from one peg to another while following a set of rules. For this project, we used A* and Greedy algorithms to find the optimal solution with the minimum number of moves.

###  A* algorithm
The A* algorithm is a search algorithm that uses heuristic evaluation to determine the next best move. It evaluates the current state of the game and calculates the estimated cost to reach the goal state. The algorithm then chooses the path with the lowest cost.

###  Greedy algorithm
In contrast, the Greedy algorithm always chooses the move that appears to be the best at the moment. It does not consider the future consequences of the move and can sometimes lead to suboptimal solutions.

### Project environment
Our project features two different modes of play: user mode and AI mode. In user mode, players can interact with the game and receive hints on the next best move. In AI mode, the game uses A* and Greedy algorithms to find the optimal solution with the fewest possible moves.

We also developed a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) using HTML, CSS, and JS that allows users to interact with the game, see the AI algorithm in action, and control the speed in AI mode.

Working on this project was a great learning experience for us, and we gained valuable insights into AI algorithms and problem-solving. We are excited to tackle more challenging problems with AI in the future! ðŸš€
